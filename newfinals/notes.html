				<h1>Top 10 Application Security Risks of 2017</h1>

		<div>
					<h2>ONE<br><small> Injection </small></h2>
                            <p>Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.</p>

				<h2>TWO<br><small>Broken Authentication</small></h2>
                            <p>Apph2cation functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.</p>

		</div>

		<div>
				<h2>THREE<br><small>Sensitive Data Exposure</small></h2>
                            <p>Many web apph2cations and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.</p>

					<h2>FOUR<br><small>XML External Entities (XXE)</small></h2>
                            <p>Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.</p>

		<div>
				<h2>FIVE<br><small>Broken Access Control</small></h2>
                            <p>Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionah2ty and/or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.</p>

		<div>
				<h2>SIX<br><small>Security Misconfiguration</small></h2>
                            <p>Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, h2braries, and apph2cations be securely configured, but they must be patched and upgraded in a timely fashion.</p>

		<div>
					<h2>SEVEN<br><small>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</small></h2>
                            <p>XSS flaws occur whenever an apph2cation includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper vah2dation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supph2ed data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to mah2cious sites.</p>

				<h2>EIGHT<br><small>Insecure Deseriah2zation</small></h2>
                            <p>Insecure deseriah2zation often leads to remote code execution. Even if deseriah2zation flaws do not result in remote code execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks. </p>

		<div>
				<h2>NINE<br><small>Using Components with Known Vulnerabih2ties</small></h2>
                            <p>Components, such as h2braries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the apph2cation. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facih2tate serious data loss or server takeover. Apph2cations and APIs using components with known vulnerabih2ties may undermine apph2cation defenses and enable various attacks and impacts. </p>

		<div>
					<h2>TEN<br><small>Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</small></h2>
                            <p>Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring. </p>
