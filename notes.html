			<h4>What is a Java Servlet?</h4>
				<p>Java Servlet technology was created as a portable way to provide dynamic, user-oriented content. A servlet is a Java programming language class used to extend the capabilities of servers that host applications accessed by means of a request-response programming model. Although servlets can respond to any type of request, they are commonly used to extend the applications hosted by web servers. For such applications, Java Servlet technology defines HTTP-specific servlet classes.</p>
				<p>The <i>javax.servlet</i> and <i>javax.servlet.http</i> packages provide interfaces and classes for writing servlets. All servlets must implement the <b>Servlet interface</b>, which defines lifecycle methods. When implementing a generic service, you can use or extend the <b>GenericServlet</b> class provided with the Java Servlet API. The <b>HttpServlet</b> class provides methods, such as <i>doGet</i> and <i>doPost</i>, for handling HTTP-specific services.</p>
			<h4>Servlet Lifecycle</h4>
				<p>The lifecycle of a servlet is controlled by the container in which the servlet has been deployed. When a request is mapped to a servlet, the container performs the following steps.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>If an instance of the servlet does not exist, the web container:
						<ul>
							<li>Loads the servlet class</li>
							<li>Creates an instance of the servlet class</li>
							<li>Initializes the servlet instance by calling the init method</li>
							<li>Invokes the service method, passing request and response objects</li>
						</ul></li>
					<li>If it needs to remove the servlet, the container finalizes the servlet by calling the servlet's destroy method.</li>
					<p> A Java container also known as a Web container interacts wth Java Servlets and is responsible for managing a Servlet's lifecycle. </p>
					<p> e.g. Tomcat, Glassfish, Jetty, Virgo, Wildfly </p>

      <h3 id="JSPNotes">Java Server Pages(JSP)</h3>
		<h4>What is JSP?</h4>
			<p>Java Server Pages (JSP) is a server-side programming technology that enables the creation of dynamic, platform-independent method for building Web-based applications based on HTML, XML, or other document types. Released in 1999 by Sun Microsystems, JSP is similar to PHP and ASP, but it uses the Java programming language.</p>
			<p>To deploy and run JavaServer Pages, a compatible web server with a servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, is required. JSP has access to the entire family of Java APIs, including the JDBC API to access enterprise databases.</p>
	<p>Architecturally, JSP may be viewed as a high-level abstraction of Java servlets. JSPs are translated into servlets at runtime, therefore JSP is a Servlet; each JSP servlet is cached and re-used until the original JSP is modified. The difference of JSP with Java servlets is that, servlets are HTML in Java, while JSP is Java in HTML.</p>
 	 <p> Through the use of servlets, Java Server Pages control the content of Web Pages. </p>
	<p>  Technology for developing dynamic pages. </p>
	<h4> Elements of Java Server Pages </h4>
	<p> I. Scriptlet </p>
	<p> - a scriptlet contains Java language statements, variables, methods, declarations, or expressions. </p>
	<p> Syntax: </p>
	<p> <% java source code %> </p>
	<p> II. Declarations </p>
	<p> - Declarations declare one or more variables/methods that can be used for the
		java code in the JSP file. </p>
		<p> Syntax</p>
		<p><%! declaration; [ declaration; ]+ ... %> </p>
		<p>III. Expressions  </p>		
		<p>- JSP expressions contains a scripting language expression that is evlauted then converted to a string and inserted where the 
			expression appears in the JSP File. </p>
		<p> Syntax: </p>
		<p> <%= expression %> </p>
		<p> IV. JSP Comments </p>
		<p> Syntax: </p>
		<p> <%-- JSP Comment --%> </p>
		<p> V. JSP Directives </p>
		<p>- Directives in JSP affects the whole structure of a servlet class </p>
		<p> - JSP directives can contain a number of attributes whicn can be list down as key-value oaris and are separated by commas. </p>
		<p> Syntax: </p>
		<p> <%@ directive attribute="value" %> </p>

		<h4>What is PHP?</h4>
			<p>PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor. This confuses many people because the first word of the acronym is the acronym. This type of acronym is called a recursive acronym. PHP is an HTML-embedded scripting language. Much of its syntax is borrowed from C, Java and Perl with a couple of unique PHP-specific features thrown in. The goal of the language is to allow web developers to write dynamically generated pages quickly.</p>
			<p>PHP development began in 1994 when Rasmus Lerdorf wrote several Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs in C, which he used to maintain his personal homepage. He extended them to work with web forms and to communicate with databases, and called this implementation "Personal Home Page/Forms Interpreter" or PHP/FI.</p>
			<p>What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.</p>
		<h4>PHP Version Release</h4>
			<p>The PHP language evolved without a written formal specification or standard until 2014, leaving the canonical PHP interpreter as a de facto standard.</p>

		<h4>What is Node.JS?</h4>
			<p>Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem,<b>npm</b>, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.</p>
			<p>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.</p>
			<p>Node.js uses a single threaded model with event looping. Event mechanism helps the server to respond in a non-blocking way and makes the server highly scalable as opposed to traditional servers which create limited threads to handle requests. Node.js uses a single threaded program and the same program can provide service to a much larger number of requests than traditional servers like Apache HTTP Server.</p>
		<h4>Brief History</h4>
			<p>Node.js was originally written by Ryan Dahl in 2009,about thirteen years after the introduction of the first server-side JavaScript environment, Netscape's LiveWire Pro WebThe initial release supported only Linux and Mac OS X. Its development and maintenance was led by Dahl and later sponsored by Joyent.</p>
			<dl>
				<dt>June 2011</dt>
					<dd>Microsoft and Joyent implemented a native Windows version of Node.js.</dd>
				<dt>January 2012</dt>
					<dd>Dahl stepped aside, promoting coworker and npm creator Isaac Schlueter to manage the project</dd>
				<dt>January 2014</dt>
					<dd>Schlueter announced that Timothy J. Fontaine would lead the project.</dd>
				<dt>December 2014</dt>
					<dd>Indutny started io.js, a fork of Node.js. Due to the internal conflict over Joyent's governance, io.js was created as an open governance alternative with a separate technical committee.</dd>
				<dt>June 2015</dt>
					<dd>Node.js and io.js communities voted to work together under the Node.js Foundation.</dd>
				<dt>September 2015</dt>
					<dd>Node.js v0.12 and io.js v3.3 were merged back together into Node v4.0. </dd>

		<h4> Handling HTTP Requests in Node.js </h4> 
			<p> I. Using the Standard HTTP Library </p>
			<p> - Node.js comes with a standard library that allows you to use it quickly without having to install 
				external dependencies. </p>
			<p> II.  Using the Request Library </p>
			<p> - The Request Library helps to go through tasks swiftly and efficiently. </p>

      		<h3 id="Cookies"> Cookies </h3>
			<h4> What are Cookies? </h4>
				<p> - Cookies are usually embedded in a web browser and is used to identify the user. </p>
			
			<h4> Cookies Attributes (PHP)</h4>
			<p> - The <em> <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly"> httponly </a> attribute </em> is an attribute that doesn't reveal the cookie to a third party despite a trigger or a link
				that enables <a href = "https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-site_Scripting_(XSS)" > XSS attacks </a> (Sscripts injected into websites). </p>
			<p> - The <em> <a href= "https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SecureFlag"> Secure </a> Attribute </em> doesn't allow the cookie to be observed by unauthorized parties, and that cookies
				are only sent in a secure channel (HTTPS) </p>
			
			<h4> Syntax </h4>
			<p> - The <em> setcookie() </em> function is used to create a cookie and that the <em> name </em> attribute is the only required attribute. </p>
			<p> 	For example: setcookie(name, value, time, domain secure, httponly); </p>
			<p> - Note that the setcookie() function must appear before the html tags. </p>
			<p> - To identify whether the cookie is set, the <em> isSet() </em> function is used, usually in an if statement. </p>
			<p> - To modify the value of the cookie, the <em> setcookie() </em> just have to be called again, and then values may be updated. </p>
			<p> - The deletion of the cookie requires, once again, the <em> setcookie() </em> function, and the expiration of the cookie should be set to a past date. </p>
			
		</div>
		<div class="subtopic">
      		<h3 id="SessionHandling">Session Handling (PHP)</h3>
			<h4> What is Session handling? </h4>
			
			<p> - HTTP is a stateless protocol, or that is "serves and forgets".
			<p> - In modern websites, a series of request and response messages are usually associated to one user. Some needs to retain the information or status about them for a span of multiple requests.</p>
			<p> - A <em> Web Session </em> is a sequence of these requests associated to one user.</p>
			<p> - A <em> Session ID </em> or a token is a name=value pair, and is a unique ID of the session. </p>
			<p> - It is important that information about the session should be secured and hidden from clients for the exposure of such will result will eventually lead to session highjacking attacks. These attacks are mainly with the 
				intent of impersonating an authenticated user. </p>
			<p> - It is recommended that these tokens are at a length of at least 16 bytes (or 128 bits) so it is harder to guess or to get in the hands of potential attackers. </p>
			<p> - the logic behind the sessions must be stored in the server side.
			<p> - Sessions normally keep track of the users' IP Address, User-Agent of the user, username and password, privilege level, current state, last login, and the time out of the session </p>
    	
			<h3> Syntax (PHP) </h3>
			<p> - Inside the php script that must be put ahead of the html tags in the document, the <em> session_start(); <em> function is placed to commence the session. </p>
			<p> - As aforementioned, session variables my be utilized and theredore in order to do so, variable declarations such as <em> $_SESSION["anyvariable"] = "variablevalue"; </em> are placed. </p>
			<p> - To access these values and display them, the global $_SESSION variable is accessed. </p>
				<p>	For example: echo "The value is" . $_SESSION["anyvariable"] . "." </p> <br>
				
				<p> - The <em> session_unset() </em> function is used to remove all session variables. </p>
				<p> - The <em> session_destroy() </em> function, on the other hand, is used to destroy the session. </p>

			<h3>introduction to web application security</h3>
			<p>With the advancements in information technology and web applications, the way information / data is shared have changed . With the changes in technology, web applications are becoming more prevalaent in businesses. Demands form users also changed, individuals want to access their data anywhere and anytime. With the changes in the digital world, businesses are also changing their ways, online banking systems, and onlineshopping websites have emerged which makes it more convenient for some people who would want to do certain things in the comfort of their own homes.  Though these advancements provide convenience and efficieny for end users, these advancement sattracted people who intend to do malicious activities like Hackers, Cyber criminals, and Scammers which led to the birth of Web Application and Security.</p>
			<h3>about owasp</h3>
				<p>The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to develop, purchase, and maintain applications and APIs that can be trusted.</p>
			<h3>what are application risks</h3>
				<p>Attackers can potentially use many different paths through your application to do harm to your business or organization. Each of these paths represents a risk that may, or may not, be serious enough to warrant attention. Sometimes these paths are trivial to find and exploit, and sometimes they are extremely difficult. Similarly, the harm that is caused may be of no consequence, or it may put you out of business. To determine the risk to your organization, you can evaluate the likelihood associated with each threat agent, attack vector, and security weakness and combine it with an estimate of the technical and business impact to your organization. Together, these factors determine your overall risk.</p>
			<h3>what changed from 2013 top 10 web app security risks</h3>
				<img src="media/WASComparison.png">
			<h3>top 10 application security risks of 2017</h3>
				<ol id="top10">
					<li>Injection</li>
						<p>- Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query. The attacker’s hostile data can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization.</p>
					<li>Broken Authentication</li>
						<p>- Application functions related to authentication and session management are often implemented incorrectly, allowing attackers to compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.</p>
					<li>Sensitive Data Exposure</li>
						<p>- Many web applications and APIs do not properly protect sensitive data, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may steal or modify such weakly protected data to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser.</p>
					<li>XML External Entities (XXE)</li>
						<p>- Many older or poorly configured XML processors evaluate external entity references within XML documents. External entities can be used to disclose internal files using the file URI handler, internal file shares, internal port scanning, remote code execution, and denial of service attacks.</p>
					<li>Broken Access Control</li>
						<p>- Restrictions on what authenticated users are allowed to do are often not properly enforced. Attackers can exploit these flaws to access unauthorized functionality and/or data, such as access other users' accounts, view sensitive files, modify other users’ data, change access rights, etc.</p>
					<li>Security Misconfiguration</li>
						<p>- Security misconfiguration is the most commonly seen issue. This is commonly a result of insecure default configurations, incomplete or ad hoc configurations, open cloud storage, misconfigured HTTP headers, and verbose error messages containing sensitive information. Not only must all operating systems, frameworks, libraries, and applications be securely configured, but they must be patched and upgraded in a timely fashion.</p>
					<li>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</li>
						<p>- XSS flaws occur whenever an application includes untrusted data in a new web page without proper validation or escaping, or updates an existing web page with user-supplied data using a browser API that can create HTML or JavaScript. XSS allows attackers to execute scripts in the victim’s browser which can hijack user sessions, deface web sites, or redirect the user to malicious sites.</p>
					<li>Insecure Deserialization</li>
						<p>- Insecure deserialization often leads to remote code execution. Even if deserialization flaws do not result in remote code execution, they can be used to perform attacks, including replay attacks, injection attacks, and privilege escalation attacks. </p>
					<li>Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities</li>
						<p>- Components, such as libraries, frameworks, and other software modules, run with the same privileges as the application. If a vulnerable component is exploited, such an attack can facilitate serious data loss or server takeover. Applications and APIs using components with known vulnerabilities may undermine application defenses and enable various attacks and impacts. </p>
					<li>Insufficient Logging & Monitoring</li>
						<p>- Insufficient logging and monitoring, coupled with missing or ineffective integration with incident response, allows attackers to further attack systems, maintain persistence, pivot to more systems, and tamper, extract, or destroy data. Most breach studies show time to detect a breach is over 200 days, typically detected by external parties rather than internal processes or monitoring. </p>
